# Laravel and beyond
## The Mission
Our goal is to build a system to manage bigger amounts of data.
What kind of data? Well, you can certainly have a say about that!

### i'm gonna do a Property agency

Some suggestions of what your webapp could do:
- Keep track of everything you read (or watch)
- Manage memberships for your local sports team
- List things you want to sell or give away

### ðŸŒ± Must have features

> These requirements are a bit more technical, to give you freedom in deciding what exact features you want to implement

- A routing system
- Best practices for PHP (PSR12, readable code, ...)
- A well written git history (if you get famous one day, it needs to be enough to be included in your biography)
- Adhere to an MCV-like structure
- Have (at least one) flow similar to CRUD
- Different types of relationships for your models (Eloquent Relations)
- Basic design (using CSS frameworks is okay, goal is to have a decent basic, so you can show it to companies later)
- Check what packages can be useful 

### ðŸŒ¼ Nice to have features (doable)

- Upgrade the design: custom CSS or finetuned usage of CSS frameworks
- Do a UX scan: what areas can be improved?
- Make use of custom error for error handling
- Find a Laravel technique which is new to you to apply

### ðŸŒ³ Nice to haves (hard)

- A login system & user management
- Rights management: pay attention to who is allowed to change what items
